# Claude Code Bootstrap

Set up Claude Code for any project in minutes.

## Quick Start (Claude Code Users)

Open Claude Code and paste this entire message:

```
Hello! I'm making a new project.

If I don't already have a project folder, create one for me.

Then install the Claude Code Bootstrap by running:

After installation completes, run the project-bootstrap agent to set up my project.
```

That's it! Claude Code will handle everything automatically.

## Alternative: Terminal Install

```bash
cd your-project
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/C9-Tech-GtitHub/claude-code-bootstrap/main/claude-bootstrap-installer.sh)
```
